# DevLab: I2C BMM150 Magnetometer Sensor


## Introduction

The BMM150 is a triaxial digital geomagnetic sensor optimized for low-power, high-precision applications. Engineered by Bosch Sensortec, it provides absolute magnetic field measurements along the X, Y, and Z axes, suitable for electronic compassing and inertial navigation tasks.

The device integrates seamlessly via I²C or SPI, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of host controllers, including Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. Its compact form factor and minimal power profile make it ideal for space- and energy-constrained systems such as wearables, mobile robotics, and UAVs.

Built-in compensation algorithms correct soft-iron and hard-iron distortions, supporting reliable heading estimation in real-world environments. When used in conjunction with accelerometers and gyroscopes, the BMM150 enables robust 9DoF sensor fusion for advanced motion tracking and orientation systems.

## Key Features

- **Axes:** 3 (X, Y, Z)
- **Measurement Range:** ±1300 µT
- **Resolution:** ~0.3 µT
- **Power Consumption:** Ultra-low power consumption for battery-operated devices
- **Interfaces:** I²C and SPI
- **Operating Voltage (VDD / VDDIO):** 3.3 V (regulated internal voltage for sensor operation)  
- **Input Voltage via VCC Pin:** 3.6–6.0 V (through onboard voltage regulator)
- **Operating Temperature:** Wide operating range suitable for various environments
- **Additional Signals:**  
  - **DRDY** (Data Ready)  
  - **INT** (Programmable Interrupt)  

⚠️ Note: The VCC pin is connected to an onboard LDO voltage regulator. Supplying 3.3V directly to the 3V3 pin bypasses the regulator.
